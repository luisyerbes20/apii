First thing you can do is to make people aware of the resource so that they can use it to write articles. WikiProjects are a good place to leave a note. Relevant ones include Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle Ages, Wikipedia:WikiProject Saints, Wikipedia:WikiProject Catholicism and Wikipedia:WikiProject Anglicanism. Most will have a resources page somewhere listing useful books and links, so mentioning PLDD in those would be helpful. If you have a look at the history tabs of the articles on relevant subjects, you can find editors who write about these things and may find them useful. Please don't go mad.

If you add a bibliography and the article has footnotes using , include a footnote and use the  or  templates rather than just adding a mention in \"\"External links\"\". Jonas of Orléans is an example where there are mentions of the works in the PLDD, and where adding a footnote saying where to find De cultu imaginum or De Institutione regia would be useful. This would be more work for you, but it would help us and our readers more. I will change Jonas tomorrow to show what I mean and let you know when done. If you have any questions, please let me know.

How do we describe the fact that this radiation is independent of direction, as long as that direction is out of the physical surface?\n",

      "Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.\n",

Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?  I don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  I haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do.\n",

The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so I don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.\n",

This alone is not an indictment, but if you examine the actions he did NOT take, particularly his passionate, 20-point defense of WMC after one of WMC's temper tantrums, his harsh actions against skeptics are all the more suspect.

Enough so that the Christians viewed this or, at least, cast this as an institutional rejection of Christianity (culminating the hypothesized Council of Jamnia).  The polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored Christian attitudes, policies and behavior towards Jews for the next 2000 years.  This anti-Semitism is rooted in the original conflict between Jews and Christians during the formative years of early Christianity.

This is \"\"A happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B\"\".\n",

(Note:  Forgive me if I am overstating the position.)  According to this perspective, the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the NT authors or later interpreters of the NT authors.  For example, it is possible that the incidents in the NT represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy.  Later events (post Bar Kokhba) may have led to a re-interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy.  This is \"\"A never happened; a happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B\"\".\n",

The reason why it may not be so in India is because the Pashtuns and Indians have not come into contact on a large scale and perhaps even more after 1947. Also the reason you might see it on internet and blogs is because of lack of education. Perhaps 30 years ago you would hear the N-word being used like this also but later it grew out of vogue and politically incorrect. Similarly I provided an Academic Reference clearly stating that we Pashtuns find it derogatory. Hope  can respect this sentiment. Best wishes and regards\n",

      "First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your \"\"sky is blue\"\" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that \"\"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris\"\". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that \"\"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower\"\" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   \"\n",

A visa cannot issue itself, law or no law.  The system that issues visas must be informed of the visit of the royal personage, and that information can only be provided by a human.  Effectively, someone, somewhere, has to decide to approve the issuing of this visa, and after that the system does what it needs to do.  To cause such a visa to be denied might be unprecedented and unthinkable, but surely someone, somewhere, has such a hypothetical power.  That it may never be used still does not make the issuing of the visa \"\"automatic\"\", in my understanding of the word.   \"\n",

Our temple is located in Balkumari hill (near Balkumari mandir in Patan) according to the \"\"purohit \"\" of the temple who also happens to be our \"\"purohit\"\" (Sorry I can't find a good translation for this word \"\"purohit\"\" in english) has a recorded document (I can provide the document if you like to examine it, also give you the contact address of the purohit himself, whos living near Mangal Bazzar even today) states that the \"\"kul devta\"\" temple was erected at the time of Bhaskar verma by his second son Diwakar verma as a tribute to the god called \"\"Bhairav\"\" and thats how were descended and still worship the same place and temple even till this day. Also according to the same purohit we adopted \"\"Shrestha\"\" (changed from Verma) in the time of jayasthitti Malla (the reasons purohit told my there was a lot of instability in Patan and family feuds happening , but am not sure the exact reasons. If you want details, like I said I can give you the contact of  the \"\"purohit\"\" who gave me this information you can also go to him to examine the document.

I already gave you a DIRECT quote from the Anime and Manga project MoS, yet you said you still couldn't find it. That was also done after lengthy discussions during our last (and far more recent) MoS upgrade. And sorry, but as I'm actually and active member in TV, Film, and Anime and MoS I don't need to \"\"do research\"\" because I already know, however, let's actually look Category:Lists of television characters and Category:Lists of anime and manga characters and which one do you see as the naming convention used for the bulk of all lists? Let me make it easy: Television main cat has 167 lists, of which 48 use your preferred schema (and most of those are serious AfD bait), 19 follow neither convention with 13 being the Characters in/of variety of non-lists. Anime/Manga, 269 lists, only 13 of which do not use List of X characters, and of those only 4 use your preferred version, 1 uses Characters of, and the rest need renaming/merging/deleting.  Then there is the less populated Category:Lists of film characters with only 57 lists. Of those, again, 27 do not use List of X characters or are not actual lists. Of those 27, 3 use the Characters of/in, 1 uses X characters, and 23 use your preferred List of characters in/of X. So, vast majority of all of those use List of X characters, and most of those that don't aren't lists that their respective projects would even approve of their existance, and if kept as is, would be renamed. So, where is your research to actually show that yours is preferred, except by a single project which also rejects other guidelines. Where is the overall naming guideline that truly supports your claim without special interpretation? And where is your discussions giving consensus to begin renaming any such lists you feel doesn't meet this personal interpretation without any discussion.   (talk · contribs) \n",

There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself. \"\"Sinusoids\"\" is another result of your imagination as NO REFERENCE ON LSSA EVER MENTIONS IT, so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance, cleaning your shit is what it is.  \"\n",

This points the finger at Phelps' being in the Prague safe house prior to his purportedly first meeting with the team to discuss the mission and where he incidentally mentions his stay at the Drake.

This has been due to early influence from a single editor, which has since gone unchallenged until a year ago or so. Now, we finally have the consensus to change over to a ranked system, the only problem is that there seem to be no-one capable (or willing) of doing the coding of something as complex as a taxo-box. The bio-editors over at Norwegian WP are just just a handful of people, all of which seem to be as techically inclined as yours truly.\n",

Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.

This is just another stupid assumption made again and again by lazy researchers. We don't know why they went extinct. We know they were hunted off Iceland, perhaps New England (iirc), and perhaps elsewhere (the Basques were at least aware of them c. 1611). We don't know the historic size of that population, how long they were hunted, how many were caught per year, or the composition (sex, age) of the catch. Do not restore my revert until you find proof (not circumstantial evidence, e.g. increase in whaling activity on entirely different species coincided with the disappearance of the gray whale in the North Atlantic) that whaling was the cause of the extinction of Atlantic gray whales (good luck with that, because you won't find it).\n",

In the lead it would have been sufficient to just say something like: \"\"The material conditional is to be distinguished from logical entailment (which is usually symbolosed using [double turnstile].\"\"  The distinction can then be detailed in the body of the article.  Also the failure to even mention propositional calculus  which is the context in which someone is most likely to look up the meaning of the operator  was an unacceptable omission.  By the time someone reaches the study of paraconsistent logical systems they will likely have no need to look up what a material conditional is on Wikipedia.

      "Ok, then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where D contributes to generic programming. If Dmeranda is correct in that \"\"static if\"\" is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified, and I'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since I failed to get that point. Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too. Thus in short, the section should be condensed, sharpened to drive the relevant points home, and a better example should be found (invented?).

I have repeatedly told this incidence several times, and this proved to me a point: our system is subjective in many cases rather most of the cases.

However, this should not be a cause for despondency and disappointment as I had found that good editors would survive in the long run.

On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?\n",
      "Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?\n",

      "I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of Ed, based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the \"\"conserv\"\" in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console Ed on his good faith attempt to serve the community again. Please do not wheel war over this block. I will just go do some move to commons until it is resolved satisfactorily. Cheers!   \"\n",

      " Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts. WP:AGF should be sufficient for such a report making a statement like \"\"this is the first (last) episode character/actor-so-and-so appeared in, and so forth.

Everything mentioned in The Mosquito#Health effects should be taken seriously; it's not simply a “noise”, it’s a pulsing. Something like this: |>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-|>-. Bang loud, quickly fades out, and then repeats, probably 2-3 times per second. When I came across them, it went straight to my inner ear and made me disoriented within seconds and physically nauseous within a minute of exposure. The fact that it emits at up to 94 decibels, to me, should make it highly controversial. At 85 dB, OSHA requires hearing protection in a factory. 94 decibels is louder than a lawnmower, and these speakers are usually stuck run above your head on sidewalks. To some of the previous comments in this article, to me, The Mosquito less of an anti-loitering machine and more of a military sound-weapon. It is truly that bad; imagine an instant, pulsing ear infection simply because you walked past a department store that doesn't want kids loitering about. Just my 2 cents.  (talk)(contribs)\n",

I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.\n",

      "In 1912 (long before Landis) Cobb attacked a fan in the stands and was suspended. The fan was indeed handicapped, but he was also hurling vile words at Cobb, who wouldn't put up with it. His teammates went on a one-day strike, then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't. Cobb did not escape suspension, he served it. The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer, about a game several years earlier. It was that one player's word against theirs, hence insufficient evidence. Landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars (like Ruth) when it seemed warranted. The stats for Jackson in the '19 Series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win. I don't know that he denied throwing the Series, some sources claim that. But did he keep the money? Far as I know, he did. There is a rule that banned players can't be in the Hall, because their actions are ON THE FIELD, and are a stain on the game.\n",

I also, to say it once more, do not question that the referenced source about Pakistan might indeed have said that \"\"E3b is common in Europe\"\" though referring to what we can also read in articles about more specifically about Europe. So I am questioning the type of referencing in the Wikipedia of which this is a discussion page, which seems extreme. Nothing else. Please address that. I have also explained specifically why I think this. Please read what I wrote again and respond to what I really wrote? The way I understand it, an article on Pakistan is being used simply in order to justify the word \"\"common\"\", whereas the articles about Europe, which both the Wikipedia article and the Pakistan E3b article must refer to, perhaps do not use that exact word, but rather give more detailed and less vague numbers and comments?

If he doesn't want to believe that, and if it makes him feel better to delude himself into thinking that I'm a lesbian, which it obviously does, then so be it. To everyone else, if you haven't already, see what Dennis Brown states about MikeFromCanmore's POV above and what he states about it in this diff. And see here for an updated version of that discussion. The bias that MikeFromCanmore speaks of is imaginary, and so is the harassment. As many can attest to, it has been him who has constantly harassed others, including me, being all kinds of uncivil and therefore repeatedly violating the WP:CIVIL policy. He has repeatedly removed information about studies, both at the Lesbianism in erotica article and at the Lesbian sexual practices article, and and is now trying to replace the information at the Lesbian sexual practices article with other information. Even if the other information is allowed, that doesn't mean that the information he wants removed should be removed. There's no Wikipedia policy that states that it should be removed. And if his material is added, it should be added with WP:DUE WEIGHT. All of this, his behavior and sourcing, was already thoroughly addressed at User talk:Drmies and partly at Dennis Brown's tak page (linked above). This user doesn't understand WP:Verifiability or any other Wikipedia policy or guideline, and cannot grasp any Wikipedia policy or guideline when it's explained to him. I removed his posts because of what I stated here. Even with me posting this, he will make more excuses for his behavior, try to deflect attention on me, and will use ridiculous rationale for why the information he wants removed should be removed. I never stated that the information he wants added shouldn't be added. I'm against him removing reliably sourced content because he doesn't like it/because he feels that the WP:Secondary reliable sources are not reliable because they don't list stats for the information (which is part of his failure to grasp WP:Verifiability. 220.255.2.122\n",

At the time a close variant of this statement was first inserted into the article, there was an then ongoing discussion relating to the inclusion of the Time Magazine cover image involving WP technical minutiae relating to WP:NFC. In my opinion and that of other participants, it was a reasonable editorial discretionary decision to include it, though the precise formulation plainly is questionable and subject to debate in particular about the second and third question presented. That question reads: \"\"If so, does the evidence support it and related explanations of the history of life on Earth?\"\" It's followed by the assertion that \"\"if the answer to either question is negative\"\" then the third question follows. IMO, this, although reasonable, is just edItorial opinion. The paragraph with the three questions was just very recently flagged for citation, which according to a strict reading of WP:V allows for its removal, at least lacking a consensus override of its removal. After initially resisting, I support its removal. .....

Stopping at 15 miles you don't even make it into Missouri, you barely make it across the Johnson County border with Wyandotte County. I'd be ok with a 15-20 mile statement, but my hang-up is you are still in Kansas Dorothy. Kansas City's Downtown is not 5 miles wide, so a more accurate range is needed. Maybe try 18-21 miles, cuz at 18 you've at least crossed the border. Yes, you can be in Kansas City at 15 miles, but you are not downtown, in fact MNU is only about 8 miles from the south part of Kansas City (take 135st/HWY150), but that is not downtown (and even further from the Kansas City International Airport). And I'm confused to why we will use the image from the institutional website claiming to the be most reliable, but yet third party site milage site is more reliable than the institutional website milage? Would not the institutional website be reliable for both? As far as 19 and 20 go... 19 is an exact measurement, and the word about was to suppose to give some leeway, as to make it an approximate of 20 (a nice even number) miles.

      " Firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through RfC: , the  closer or the first Articles for deletion discussion, , who as far as I can tell played no part in earlier discussions,  who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions, and , an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said \"\"If you can't be bothered with an RfC then we can't be bothered with an arbitration case.\"\"  has also remarked on your failure to follow process here.\n",

      "But finally, despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to RfC, you say that I in particular am only asking you to go to RfC \"\"to delay the inevitable\"\".  Well I'm not sure that you and I can agree on what \"\"the inevitable\"\" is in this case.  To my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldn't like to hear what the arbitrators have to say, and they've hinted on this in their comments on the case.  But since they're obviously not going to accept the case until you've at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution, I'm urging you to do so.  If an arbitration case follows, the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned, so get cracking. Tony Sidaway \"\n",

      "Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: \"\"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment.\"\" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brunton's beginning point is that: \"\"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is \"\"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks\"\" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The \"\"spiritual bypass\"\" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case. All I ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic.   \"\n",

Arabic sources overwhelmingly do call it a massacre, and thus, the wiki being a product of its sources, the article is called the gaza massacre. This whole time you have been arguing that arabs shouldnt be calling it a massacre, that the facts dont support such a claim. That opinion, whether valid or not, is not what determines the name of an article, it is what the common name in the language for the event that determines the name. You cannot argue that the 2 wikis are discussing the same event, so to then argue that because of the common name for said event is in your mind, and understandably so, non-neutral that we should then censor that undermines core principles of the wikis. Yes the wiki should server to convey facts and hopefully transfer knowledge, but what we think are facts are almost always perceptions of facts. It boggles my mind that something that should be as trivial as asking what is the common term associated with an event in a given language needs to be so difficult. If arabs are calling this event the gaza massacre, then surprise! the name of the article will be the gaza massacre.\n",

The word \"\"fuck,\"\" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what \"\"fuck\"\" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning \"\"fuck\"\" (or \"\"fucking\"\") and the euphemism \"\"sleeping together\"\" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. \n",

And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and \"\"fuck\"\" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word \"\"fuck\"\" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why \"\"fuck\"\" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that \"\"fuck\"\" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity.

Therefore, the acceleration of the Earth is 1024 times smaller than the acceleration of the hammer, so if the hammer falls through 1 m, the Earth will move 10-24 m during the same time. Such short distances, which correspond to an energy of 100000 TeV, are not probed even by the most energetic particle accelerators! Let's now do another calculation. Suppose we're dropping the feather. The hammer, which is presumably on the ground, attracts the feather with its gravity. The additional acceleration of the feather is given by GM/r2, where M is the mass of the hammer and r is the distance from the feather to the hammer. This gives roughly 10-10 m/s2, which is much bigger than the effect suggested by the Anonymous.\n",

Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30\n",

NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page.

      "First off, your baseless accusations. You accused me of bad faith. Precious. As recently as yesterday you refereed to the inclusion of Dado Prso's first name in the article (as is the case on hundreds of other sportspeople bios throughout Wiki), as a \"\"Serb nationalist talking point\"\", a \"\"thinly veiled political advocacy\"\", and an \"\"unverified Serbian name claim\"\", also back in 2006 you were dismissive of the AFP source, at one point even calling for Prso's ID scan. When I brought this up, your response was calling it a figment of my imagination and making ridiculous accusations of bad faith!? You also accused me of proving a point, basing it on my mere presence here. The only reason I'm here posting on this page now is your removal of Prso's first name based on a claim that its inclusion is \"\" tendentious & unreferenced\"\". Clearly there are and there have been references on this page all along. Frankly I found it extremely unlikely that someone as nit-picky and anal as you would fail to notice the references on the talk page when you removed the first name from the article, but I guess it's possible. Also, as per your \"\"I (Joy) didn't overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page\"\" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses. So assuming in good faith that your failure to notice them now in 2014 was an honest oversight on your part I have to inform you once again that you DID overlook them because they've been here all this time. For the dissection of the Nezavisne ref, I'm not even sure what you're pushing and arguing for there. Nobody on this page, least of all me, has disputed that he goes by Dado (the article is called Dado Prso in case you failed to notice that too) so why you felt compelled to argue that is beyond me. From the best that I could gather, you don't want his first name Miladin in the intro, but you can live with it in the 'early career' section and you're basing all of this this on the fact that when you total them up most references are to Dado and Miladin, which is completely ridiculous, IF this is what you're arguing for (if not forget the previous sentence). Yes, of course they're to Dado, this is what he goes by, but that doesn't negate his first name.  \"\n",

It doesn't mean that if a figure also exists in Christianity too that this figure becomes only an article based on the perspective. Isa in his own self can have an article just like Yeahua and Jesu that do exist. It's not simply one perspective of that same person, it's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't simply a fact that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name.

Generally speaking, the CA category appears to be divided between examples of cellular automata (Immigration (CA), QuadLife, Rule 110 cellular automaton) and terms related to cellular automata (Garden of Eden pattern, Gun (CA), Oscillator (CA)) - to such an extent that it might be best to divide this category into two subcategories. What you don't find in this category, however, are people who have contributed to cellular automata, regardless of their distinction. What we can do, however - I'll be glad to contribute, and it'd be nice if you helped to - is possibly create a subcategory, \"\"Scientists who have made a major contribution to cellular automata\"\" (or, for preference, a shorter name, if you can come up with one), and in this category place Mr von Neumann.

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: \"\"Do no harm.\"\" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.\n",

I wanted to add Fauvism, Figures and Abstract but, decided to err on the conservative side for total numbers of images.\n",

There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make.

When you leave a bare URL like this and the link goes dead later, there's often no way to recover the content.  talk/contribs \"\n",

      "Gen Y definitely begins in 1978. A previous author was right when she mentioned that people born in that era (1978-1984) are pretty in between, the same way people born in the early 1960s are between the classic generation X and the classic baby boom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there is a difference between early Generation Yers (1978-1984) and late Generation Yers (1985-1994) but I don't think people born after about 1993 or 1994 can be included in Generation Y. Part of being Gen Y is being a child of a baby boomer. My parents were born in 1955 and I was born in 1990. The baby boomers are a pretty unified generation, and even my parents consider themselves to be part of a different generation than people born in the 1940s. My parents are children of the '70s, Watergate era, and came of age as adults during the late 1970s and early 1980s yuppie/disco era. Meanwhile, someone born in 1946 remembers the conformity of the 1960s and was in high school as opposed to grade school during the JFK assassination, and could have been drafted for Vietnam. They were old enough to take part in the antiwar protests or go to Woodstock. After about 1954 the boomers were children of the '70s, while before they were children of the '60s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same distinction exists between early and late Y. Early Y is a transitional group between Generation X and Generation Y, and their coming-of-age was characterized by alot of change (PCs, etc.) Also, their parents included more Vietnam vets and protestors, and hippies, while most people my age have parents whose adolescent preoccupations were disco and Led Zeppelin-type rock, Watergate and the oil crisis.\n",

You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google \"\"South Ossetia War\"\". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title \"\"SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA\"\" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the \"\"2008 Georgia War\"\" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased.

This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.

The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.

      "The emergence of reputation systems\n",
      "How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up \"\"distributed court of opinion.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve \"\"naturally\"\" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an \"\"ingenuity gap.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of \"\"Garbage In, Garbage Out\"\" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Peter Drucker argued that \"\"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\"\" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.\"\"\n",
      "In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to \"\"think smarter, not harder\"\" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be \"\"wired together\"\" more efficiently.\n",

Because it now reads: \"\"martyred\"\" and \"\"mostly Roman Catholics and Chinese\"\" and it is not a neutral point of view. \"\"...other churches recognized their own martyrs\"\" implies that the others who were killed for their faith were not part of \"\"THE Chines Martyrs\"\". The fact that they are accepted as \"\"martyrs\"\" by the Roman church does not make them \"\"martyrs\"\" in the Orthodox or even the Protestant sense. So, since the meager content of this stub is mostly about the Roman Catholic individuals who were cannonized, it is appropriate to divide things and qualify things as I had done. There are undoubtably many who will oppose the term \"\"Martyrs\"\" itself in the title because of the modern cultural connotations that it carries like \"\"Martyrs of Sept. 11 (hijackers)...But it does work if this article is limited to the Papal decree that popularized a phrase - if that is what it is. \"\n",

That doesn't mean Wikipedia relies on a democratic definition of truth. If we did, we would have to state, as a fact, that God exists, because a majority of the world's English-speaking people believe that claim to be true. Fortunately for God, he's still got some gaps to hide in, so for the time being the existence of God is not a scientific question. But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful. Wikipedia can certainly report on who believes what. We have a List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming.\n",

One other strange thing that I have been hearing from my friend about is people going and validating their PC on the Microsoft Download Center to access a downolad. After the download is complete they run an antispyware program and find that the WGA validation tool has caused a Browser Hijack attempt.

      "If you want to include a reference mentioning tea tree oil as a common folk remedy but not giving directions, instructions, advice or amounts to use, go for it!  However, keep in mind that past versions of that parargraph had been edited to take out medical advice added by well-meaning editors who thought giving exact instructions on how to use tea tree oil to treat ringworm was appropriate.  That we cannot leave in because it constitutes medical advice.  Past versions of this article and other articles on pet medical issues such as ticks often wind up with edits telling people to use this household cleanser or that easily obtained chemical and more often than not, that advice is foolish and dangerous.  I probably could have softened the wording a bit but I was getting tired of editors using articles on topics such as these to insert potentially disasterous advice.  Whatever you link to, be sure it meets the reliability standard and be mindful of the potential harm to people and animals that a link to an casual recipe for a cure could cause.  I'm sure there are many decent references and quotes you could find to support the efficacy of tea tree oil as a folk remedy and the theory behind it!  As to Wikipedia's own article, one wikipedia article cannot cite another to reference a statement but... if that article already has a reference that supports the contention of it's efficacy, well, by all means nab that citation!\n",

      "I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. \n",

      "\n",
      "Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:\n",
      "Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. \n",
      "So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:\n",
      "“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing\n",
      "\n",
      "-TABpayment of dividends to shareholders;\n",
      "-TABreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;\n",
      "-TABa company’s purchase of its own shares\n",
      "\n",
      "and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court\"\".\n",

      "Thanks. After the moderator bug happened a couple of days ago, one non-mod was able to modify the welcome page and have his changes realised within VP, and then there was some chat in IRC about how easy it would be to get by my \"\"security.\"\" The mod bug resulted from problems in reading the page history (I'll spare you the technical details), and if someone managed to move the page along with its history, it would be very simple for anyone to edit the resulting redirect to include their username and have his changes realized (as well as to disable the tool for everyone else, except for me of course =)). And especially since I'm now adding this \"\"revert all user contributions\"\" feature in the next release, I'm getting a little concerned about abuse. S-protecting's probably not neccessary at all, but I figured it wouldn't hurt anyone; the page move protection, however, could save me and other editors a lot of headaches. If you feel the need to add the template, would it be possible to add it further down the page (in the command's section) or on the talk page? Do you list userpages on WP:PP? I can think of quite a few admins with protected userpages, and it doesn't seem particularly vital to alert others when pages in userspace are protected, but I wouldn't object to your listing it there. As I said before, s-protection isn't really too necessary, so if you'd rather it just be move-protected, feel free to lift the semiprotection. Thanks again for your help! It's much appreciated.

On the other hand, if the Beat Generation includes dozens and dozens of artists, including not only writers but also dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, then the Beat Generation does not exist because the concept is too loose, too vague.\"\"\n",

      "For this one, there may be some confusion by what Kerouac means by “people who had been beaten down” since that could apply to either the small group or the broader subculture. However, Morgan provides the same definition I presented earlier in which Kerouac identifies it as “certain members of the generation that came of age after World War II who affected detachment,” etc. It’s conceivable that one might argue Kerouac meant his group of friends by “certain people, but from many other sources, he meant the broader subculture (open for debate, but let’s have that debate instead of blindly dismissing without evidence to support counterclaims). Here’s the quote from Morgan:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once the press began to identify those writers collectively as ‘the Beat Generation,’ some within the group began to struggle with a definition for the word beat. Since it was Jack Kerouac who had originally coined the phrase, he was asked repeatedly what he meant by it. Initially he said that the Beat Generation was composed of people who had been beaten down, worn out, and exhausted. As time passed, he refined his definition to emphasize the beatific, blessed, or sympathetic qualities of his generation.”\n",

      "I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.\n",

      "The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.\n",

Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women.

Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.\n",

I feel so bad for her, at first i was like YAY Victor/Sharon are getting married maybe he really loves her..but then i realized it wasn't for love but for revenge. And WTF is with her & Tucker? NO. Just ...NO. They would not make a good romance. I want Sharon to be single or with Nick. That's it for me lmaoo. I don't really care about Jill anymore tbh. I'm very picky, which is why I don't watch full episodes anymore from SOAPS (other then DOOL, i can enjoy the whole episode of that). OMG i love Sharon Case!! She retweets things on her twitter that are semi-insulting to MAB! LMAO! Like one person said, Sharon you finally get your character back now that MAB is gone.  JLover \n",

      "\n",
      "0 - Create a draft of the project; recruit some editors to do phase 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 - Move REALLY FAST to create campaign articles (template/shell/skeleton/whatever) for all competitive races where an incumbent won or there was an open race.  Copy the info from articles on challengers into the campaign articles.  Then slap redirects on the articles on challengers (if of questionable notability) so that there is no need for AfDs for these.  (Such AfDs are bad precedent, in general a waste of time regardless of outcome, and successful AfDs could kill off source info.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2A - Refine the phases of the project and what needs to be done - for example, what a really good campaign article might contain (polls, snapshots of campaign funding at various points, results, newspaper endorsements, a good selection of links to local newspaper stories, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2B - Create campaign articles for all competitive races where a challenger defeated the incumbent. \n",

      "2C - Finish the 50-100 campaign articles for 2006 House races.  That might include a rating/evaluation of the quality of each article.\n",
      "\n",
      "2D - (Optional) - do the same for the 30+ Senate races. (I just looked at the Florida Senate campaign article the other day - except for the polling info, it's devoid of any significant content except primary results.)\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - Improve the quality of wikipedia bio articles for incumbents in competitive races (defeated or not), winning challengers, and notable but not-winning challengers: good citations, good copyediting, etc., as baseline for 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "4A - (Starting mid-2007?) Build a 2008 comprehensive master page, and set up campaign articles for every race expected to be competitive/notable (that is, every race listed on the master page).  Evaluate feasibility of doing transclusions from individual campaign articles rather than updating the master page directly.  (There are both human and technical issues here, I believe).\n",
      "\n",
      "4B - Recruit editors to take responsibility for maintaining each (individual) campaign article.  Ideally we can find 3 or 4 editors who are (a) local and (b) can work together well, for each campaign (race) expected to be notable in 2008.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Maybe you should compare your proposal to the big drive to address Un-Referenced Biographies of Living People (URBLP)s, a problem that was recognized more and more during 2009, and then blew up in controversy in January 2010, I think it was.  There was one editor deleting them by the hundreds, I think, which made others mad.  And Wikipedia was hammered in the outside news coverage about some salient bad incidents.  The problem was addressed by a big drive, with one element being wp:URBLP Wikiproject's efforts that I happened to join.  The drive was well-focused because there was a known number, 52,000, of unreferenced BLPs in a category, to be addressed, (although there were new ones coming in, and more old ones being discovered of course).  And that one editor agreed to back off, IF the number was reduced by half in six months.  That's my very imperfect understanding of the situation before I joined.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The drive I participated in worked well.  I tried to help keep focus on the goal, and in several other ways, but some others had far more direct impact than I did.  See Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Unreferenced Biographies of Living Persons/Archive 2#Goal statement.  Every day we could see the current number, and it moving or not, and some big changes were made to reduce the number of new URBLPs coming in, and some other targeted efforts were tried and some clearly made a difference while others did not.  Overall, having the big, numeric public goal that we wanted to meet, and having immediate feedback/gratification in seeing the total category's number change, was key.  It was rewarding and frustrating and a team effort going on, etc., not just a bunch of people working completely separately.  In the end the 6 month goal was finally met though it was very close.  Then I and some others dropped out but the overall problem had been somewhat \"\"solved\"\", and it's been better since, and the number was brought all the way down to 0 effectively, and is at about 2,000 now, I see. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not saying you should talk much or at all about that URBLP problem and its drive, in your opinion piece. But I think your calling for accurate measurement of the current problem, by a one-month effort to get all of the problematic articles tagged, say, the same way, would be reasonable.  There would have to be an enforceable rule made up, that prevented the paid PR persons from deleting the tags on their articles.  There was something like that with the URBLPs...I think anyone seen deleting the URBLP tag was warned and blocked as disruptive if necessary.  And then you can call for something aggressive:  like bringing the \"\"real\"\" number down to 100,000 tops within a year, or whatever.  Your estimating the problem size to be 150,000 is helpful towards setting that up.  Or you could call for something quite different.  My main reaction, anyhow, was that I expected at the end for you to call for something big.  Asking people to separately make efforts that would not even be measurable, would not be enough, IMO.  You've earned the right to call for a bigger more organized effort.\n",

      "Alright, I'm going to request another move be made to \"\"Big White (ski resort)\"\", simply because I have been skiing and snowboarding there since I was 5 years old, and so has my family dating well back into the early eighties. Television, radio, and newspaper ads all refer to it simply as \"\"Big White\"\", and the first thing that would come out of someone's mouth regarding the name would be \"\"Big White\"\", not \"\"Big White Ski Resort\"\". Wikipedia's naming conventions state that the most acceptable and commonly known name is the rightful one, so as long as it isn't misleading to the licensed or proper title. To be perfectly honest with you, I cannot recall anyone having the preference to call it \"\"Big White Ski Resort\"\" when referring to it. It's known around British Columbia and Kelowna particularly as simply \"\"Big White\"\". Besides, it's just the article's name, and within the article: \"\"Big White Ski Resort\"\" will and should continue to remain, just not as the article's title. Refer to Billy the Kid.

Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many \"\"the Nazis\"\" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the \"\"Nazis\"\" who came from \"\"Greenland or Mars\"\" or \"\"Nazi allies\"\". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. \"\"The German-led Nazi occupation\"\" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the \"\"General Government\"\" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. \n",

Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest.

      "Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, \"\"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.\"\" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.  \n",

Can't you see that you are letting your personal politics get involved with the naming of a page on English Wikipedia?  I'm sorry, but whatever the history, Alto Adige is actually the more commonly used name in the United States.  Also, as a Ladin myself, of US origin, I have no desire to play this Italian versus German game.  History is what it is, and to be honest, the Ladin speakers were there WAY before anyone was speaking Italian in the region, or when Germans migrating to the area.  So, to me even Sudtirol is from an alien authority, if you want to be entirely accurate.  But why this constant ethnic tension in Europe?  Sudtirol sounds nice, Tyrol is nice, Alto Adige is nice.  From someone looking into the Province of Bolzano, what I feel I'm seeing is some really radical politics.  I've been told by friends in Trentino that \"\"Italians\"\" don't feel welcome there.  Ironic, because you know the Italian speakers of Trentino are actually Ladin too.

      "The false prophet, the navi sheker, the \"\"madman\"\" Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: \"\"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.\"\" \n",
      "Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as \"\"a prophet from the midst of thee.\"\" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. \n",
      "Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - \"\"altering\"\" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this \"\"imitation\"\" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: \"\"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.\"\" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.\"\" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. \n",
      "The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive \"\"from the midst of thee\"\" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: \"\"I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.\"\" As it says: \"\"Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.\"\" Deuteronomy 13:1. \n",
      "\"\"A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.\"\" Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known.

There had been an ongoing discussion on the talk page by several regular contributors to Food and Drug Administration as to what to do with the content. If I recell correctly, we had not reached consensus, but there were some contributors arguing for keeping the page, merging it back to the main page, or deleting all but selected content. It is unclear to me why the page was summarily deleted, along with this entire discussion. I'd appreciate hearing what happened. Thanks. -Talk/Contribs \n",

      "There are a few problems with the lede on polyandry. (1) Only a small minority of Nairs in Central Kerala practiced this. The vast majority of those in the South and North didn't practiced it. Central Nairs are mostly Charna Nairs, who rank lower than Kiryathils of the North and Illath of South. (2) Polyandry was widely practiced in Kerala, and the main practitioners of it were not Nairs, but lower ranking Savarna castes such as Kammalans. (3) Sources about polyandry are written by a few European researchers, who don't have first hand experience about this, and many of them haven't even visited Kerala. The last recorded instance of polyandry among Nairs date back to mid-19th century (Not 1900). (4) There are travelogues written by many European explorers like Duarte Barbosa, and none of them mentions polyandry. But every single one of them mentions about the martial traditions of Nairs. I find it quite ironic that the martial history is completely ignored and POV prone issues like polyandry are given undue weight (however a few Evangelical Christian editors who are super-active here for the past 2-3 months will disagree with this statement). 160.80.2.8\n",

Her storylines started from when she came on the show for eg. the custody battle. You are really making a false distinction. I urge you to watch the videos, please. You cannot make that argument.

Collins is something of a hero to the British and the Protestant right wingers in Ireland (and are remnants of the former Protestant ruling class) since he signed the treaty to end the Irish War of Independence that created the Irish Free State.  Sinn Fein and the IRA, the left wingers and Catholic, were against it and viewed Collins as a traitor.  The Civil War resulted.  The IRA assassinated him.  The treaty allowed the British to still subjugate the Irish.  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were ecstatic.  Eamon de Valera and Sinn Fein were not.  They wanted a Republic and to be rid of the British entirely.  The British and the Irish Protestants are still big Collins' fans.

In the midst of the mid- and long-distance service improvements as are already mentioned in the article, I feel this ought to be commented upon. At the time I thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service (longer platforms, higher frequency, stops at both South Ruislip and West Ruislip, trains with faster acceleration – in short, something approaching an Overground-style service), but, as of May 2014, that hasn't happened and despite all the excitement about the Mainline service to Birmingham, the service has worsened significantly for the short-distance user. 92.40.248.181\n",

It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.

Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.

Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others.

In the 1880s & 1890s Australian colonies & New Zealand armed themselves against what what later called the \"\"Russian scares\"\"  fears of Russia controlling their sealanes and even invading. My personal theory is that this fear was built up by British arms suppliers rather than any political facts, but you seem in a position to write a balanced article if you're interested - we don't hear much from the Russian point of view on this. regards.

Besides, the order of merit usually is what, when, whose, etc. Its finer meaning can come in between this list or sometime later. This trend is seen in the pages like Ashok and Sanskrit also.

Look at the reference  where you find more references. In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory):\n",

This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras).

The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.\n",

Therefore, we must endeavour to cite useful sites with well thought out statements that have been proven influencetial one way or the other. I personally believe Belldandy to be a reflection of what men want in women ultimately. The beauty of body, mind, and soul is reflected by the male author Kosuke as he speaks for us to the world. That being said, I haven't exactly released a quality publication on the subject or multiple quality sources so I don't add my opinion or search for others who are similar and can be sourced by an internet cite alone. That is why I have continued to delete the Village People's statement, not due to disagreement(though I disagree) but due to the lack of the full article available and too much trust in the website page(which isn't even signed). What is as close to absolute as possible is the words of Fujishima Kosuke, and I am certain we can find more about what he has said on the subject in the last 21 years! Thank you for your time.\n",

Yeeaah, lets play. -D And I consider JN as sinocentric when he writes that the Chinese were the greatest sailors of all time (sic) and had dominated science and technology for full 1500 years (1-1500 AD (sic)). IMO he sails under a false flag pretending to be for international understanding, but actually psuhing heavily his sinocentric agenda. Even his inofficial 'biographer' Robert Finley said that he was (quote) \"\"always eager to inflate Chinese achievements\"\". I just returned from a three week trip to China last Sunday and bought some Chinese books which rely on his works. If you like I can quote sometime from them....\"\"the modern world is a creation of China and the West\"\"...\"\"China lead the world for most of history\"\" and sick stuff like that. Maybe I am a bit unjust to Needham as I have received much of his work through his stout sinocentric adlatus R. Temple, but you will agree with me at least that none of Needham's many diffusionist thesises (rudder, 'escapement mechanism', etc.) have been since accepted by mainstream historians - all Chinese transmission which are now largely accepted (gunpowder, paper anyway, etc.) have been already before recognized by a substantial part of Western scholars.

      "Technically you still can't distinguish acceleration from gravity - they are, in fact, one in the same. The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.\n",

In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.\n",

      "This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of \"\"Russian torsion field weapons\"\" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on \"\"The Philadelphia Experiment\"\" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the \"\"saucers\"\" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper \"\"On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics\"\". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in \"\"this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics\"\" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005\"\n",

The war is primarily about style  I have tried to make the article less wordy and better organized. But I think there is an underlying NPOV issue  not concerning the matter of abortion (pro vs. con) but concerning the role of wikipedia (to educate people about ongoing public debates over certain issues, or to provide logical arguments meant to provoke people's thoughts).

To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15\n",

      "I agree with Christopher Thomas, below, regarding unclarified sources for this article.  Specifically, I take issue with the entire \"\"Differences between the 800 and 850 series\"\" section, because I contend that there is no such thing as a \"\"T-850\"\".  Stan Winston Studios, which designed the terminators for the films, confirmed this to me via e-mail when I wrote to them asking their opinion.  Their response (direct quote): \"\"I'm not sure where the T-850 came from.  As far as I know, Arnold's Terminator has and always will be the T-800, model 101.  Now, the robot Terminators in T3 are T1's and Kristana Loken is the TX.  I hope that clears it up...\"\"  While the term \"\"T-850\"\" is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.

      "Hi, don't be confused with WP:CITE. The current state of Germany article already conforms with WP:CITE, that you use Footnote style of citing together with inline citations. So when you simply added the long list of books/publications in a newly created References section and you said that they were copy-pasted from other sub-Germany articles and they were not used in the article, then it is not correct. It should be applied also in other article, such as Canada, but it has been featured, so what can I say? There is WP:FAR for reviewing FA article again, but I guess it is not a fatal mistake in Canada. Probabily, your timing was not right. When one reviewer asked about printed sources, you answered him/her by copy-pasting a list of references. That looked like a show-off action and made him/her think that you are not serious of taking his/her comments. —  (reply) — \"\n",

      "great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called \"\"post-industrial\"\" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).\n",

      "Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as \"\"noise music\"\".\n",

We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now.

Online newspapers from places with relatively weak internet access and less developed internet/GNU/linux communities (e.g. Iraq!) probably might be volatile in the sense that after a few years they will change software/hosting/URLs or go offline for whatever reason. Another point is that webcitation.org probably doesn't (yet) have a long term reputation. archive.org and arxiv.org have been around for a long time, arxiv.org has very solid institutional backing and a huge amount of mirroring.

      "It's one thing to disagree on content, another entirely for you to make an accusation of bias. If you have any moral compass whatsoever, you will now either substantiate your accusation or withdraw it and apologise. Ad hominem attacks are not acceptable.  (talk) \n",
      "It was not an attack. It was an observation. You've already distorted her words. For example, you inserted a claim that \"\"she dismisses criticism as uninformed and bitchy\"\", which is not what the source said. If my observation was wrong, I am sorry, but I'm not convinced that it was. I hope that you will prove otherwise.   \n",
      "The leap you need to explain is how you get from your assertion of \"\"not what the source said\"\" to bias. The source said of one set of critics \"\"Gardeners are quite bitchy, aren't they\"\". Of another, \"\"There was only a handful of grand English lady designers, and the bitchiness I encountered was unbelievable\"\". These would seem to support an assertion that she dismissed critics as bitchy. How many times in one piece must we read such dismissals before we conclude that she dismisses critics as bitchy? And how, however you view my sentence construction, does it amount to bias? You have made the assertion. It is now down to you to explain yourself.  (talk) \n",

      "Bewafai is a Hindi film starring the First Superstar of Indian Cinema Rajesh Khanna[2][3][4][5][6] and the Superstar of Tamil film industry Rajnikanth together for the very first time[7].The film was directed by R. Thyagaarrajan.During the making of the Rajesh Khanna starrer super-hit film Haathi Mere Saathi(1971),the producer Dhandayuthapani was part of the crew of the film as the office administrator and R.Thyagarajan was the editor of the film.Later in the mid seventies R.Thyagarajan became a very successful director in Tamil cinema with every film directed by him becoming big hits and all those films had Rajnikanth[8] in it as the lead hero.The producer and the director duo could not get much success in Hindi cinema with their films becoming duds at the box office until this film released.The duo then decided to direct a movie in Hindi in 1985 and made a casting coup of sorts by casting Rajesh Khanna and Rajnikanth in the lead roles[9].Dhandayuthapani produced only four films[10] in Hindi with Bewafai being the most successful of them.\n",

I deleted the study by Liljegren and Ekberg although it is a well-done and interesting study. I deleted it because the research conducted did not directly concern occupational stress. The research concerned turnover intentions, turnover itself, and burnout. For example, Liljegren and Ekberg found that burnout was correlated with turnover intentions, and that people who changed their jobs lowered their scores on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Occupational stressors were not measured. Clearly the study could be mentioned in the Wikipedia article on burnout.\n",

      "I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?\n",
      " First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical \"\"rule nazi\"\" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly \"\"this user is an asshole\"\" and explain why and state \"\"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia\"\" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say \"\"asshole\"\" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a \"\"dick\"\" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.\n",
      " In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to \"\"wait until after TFA\"\" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize \"\"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.\"\"  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.\n",
      " And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's \"\"Will to Power\"\" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for why, I like \"\"nineteenth\"\" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for \"\"brevity's sake\"\" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to \"\"kick rocks.\"\"\n",

This person himself is totally disoriented and utterly confused, mentally/intellectually; and it is also very clear from his comment somewhere else about Kamboj-related articles that he does not even know the very basics of the Kamboj history.

How come these idiots, who can not even correctly interpret or understand the historical references/citations, be entrusted with the task to edit serious articles on ancient people like the Kambojas? It is  also amusing to learn that such-like dorks are trying to define the historical out-lines of the Kamboj history on Wikipedia! It is highly desirable that these fuck'in self-styled Wikipedia administrators/commentators first need to learn  to correctly interpret and interpret the historical references. Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People. Also these jerks first need to understand that the citations and quotations used in the Kamboj related articles are from the most scholarly writers on this subject. It is shameful that these FEW F*- SELF-STYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS (LIKE DABU(DAB),ITSMJUDITH and the like) are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English, Fench or German by their European writers! Well, if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article, howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history? It is first necessary that these adminitrators/editors like Fuck'n Dabbu and his ilk, first need to familiarise  themselves about the current available historical information on Kamboj history-only then can they qualify themselves to edit the serious articles on the Kambojkas?'.And, I'll see how long these ignorant, prejudiced-minded idiots can continue to block me from editing articles on  Wikipedia?????''.\n",

As for the first half of your post  the reason I am interested in your edits is because in the last five months you have made requests on ANI for me to be de fact SBANned no less than three times, and on at least two of these occasions you have justified this by claiming that the number of pages you managed to sneak past the GA review process exceeds the number of GAs I have produced. Your making bad article edits usedn't be that big a concern for me, except where you directly revert my good article edits. But once you started using the number of GA reviewers you have managed to trick into thinking you didn't misquote sources as justification for trying to get me blocked/banned, I suddenly had a massive incentive to bring to light the fact that the so-called GAs you advertise on your user page all contain serious sourcing errors.\n",

It jumps from the creation of the North West Company, to competition with the Hudson Bay company, and then all the way to its revival in 1990. There is very little explanation of the connections between these events (especially the final sentence about its revival). This makes the introduction more confusing than anything. I suggest that either the introduction be extended in order to create a thought-process that is easier to follow, or eliminate the final sentence entirely since it doesn't really relate to the rest of the paragraph. \n",

      "Okay, I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasn't Jewish.  Firstly, Marx didn't kill anybody, nor did his ideology.  A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people.  And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people, I'm not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century.  Beyond that, Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry.  His primary language was German, and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works.  Although he spent most of his later life in England, I've never really heard that he didn't always consider himself to be a German - I'd think, in fact, that living in England would have accentuated that.  While I do think that his Jewish background is important, and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew, his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one.  His own works emerged out of post-Hegelian debates within the German philosophical community, and his greatest influence throughout his life (and for several decades afterwards) was in Germany, where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe (Britain, France, and Russia, in particular, had their own, non-Marxist, socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time, if ever).  Marx was German of Jewish descent.  Being an \"\"internationalist\"\" is a statement of intentions for the future of the world, not of present day identity.   \"\n",

      "[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from \"\"Chabenisky\"\" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of \"\"World's Richest People\"\", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the \"\"largest single e-commerce transaction\"\", after he paid $40\n",

      "Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called \"\"senior staff\"\" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.\n",

      "I received a notification of this discussion on my phone on my home from work. I have read the article and while it is a worthy student essay, it is not encyclopaedic in tone and as well as the editorialisng there are errors. The discussion on rotavirus immediately grabbed my attention. It's about 20 years out of date and is sourced to a 1985 paper by de Zoysa and Feachem. This publication was important and influential at the time but has long been superseded. There has been major progress in prevention of rotaviral diarrhoea in the past 15 or so years, which the article completely ignores. It has also been known for some time that improved social conditions do little to control the incidence and prevalence of viral gastroenteritis and this is why the WHO, many years ago, supported vaccine development. I'm not convinced that there is much here – once it has been updated and the editorial comments removed – that is not already covered in our other articles which include Gastroenteritis, Rotavirus and Rotavirus vaccine.  While I applaud the contributor's enthusiasm for a subject that has been the main thrust of my research in real life, I think the salient points of this article should be merged with Gastroenteritis if they are not already covered. I don't think this contribution is worthy of a stand alone article and certainly not a GA.\n",

It would be straightforward to write a bot that (1) protected all images on the main page, adding Template:Mprotected, and (2) unprotected all images with Template:Mprotected that no longer appeared on the main page. Feature (2) would be genuinely useful and save editors work. However, if editors came to rely on feature (1) then that would introduce a risk, because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it. A clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap. And worse, the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image. I suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become.  08:13, 2005 May 13 (UTC)\n",

We, human, have got the neural network and speech  another evolutionary mechanism, which can evolve (improve the culture) separately from biology (the genes). In the neural sphere you evolve pure ideas. You produce a better idea by combining your concepts with solutions discovered by other entities. You share the ideas for improving your culture.

      "Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And \"\"Final warning\"\" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the \"\"batman\"\" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. \n",

      "(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history\n",
      "One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern \"\"Slavic\"\" and \"\"Dalmatian\"\" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.\n",

      "The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc\n",

No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.

      "You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.\n",

      " Binky, grow up. All you want is to be obstructive and destructive of real info included on WP - you're solidly outed. You might as well admit it. At least to yourself. Over here you write: \"\"You know, I like your Strauss-Kahn addition, using good sourcing, but this bit about bootlegs is your weak area. You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\": that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, \"\"source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\" is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google \"\"Fogerty bootleg\"\", though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?). I'm no expert at WP and have no time to become one - I only wanted to contribute, not to get embroiled with an apparent psychopat like you. Plus re new IPs: if frequent power-outages happen to change my IP, don't flatter yourself that it's in response to your unacceptable behaviour: you're not on par with hurricane Nina. At all. You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: \"\"despite the truth of what you were inserting\"\". Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is \"\"the truth\"\". That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed. Try it: Help info get on to WP, instead of picking quarrels by deleting what even you call \"\"the truth\"\". Focus on getting correct info on to WP, instead of getting lost in \"\"the system\"\". - That's just an idea, but think it over. It might do you good. Get well soon. Bye now.

      "Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was Croatian fascist leader,[1] revolutionist[2] and politician.[3] He ruled as Poglavnik[note 1] of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia.[4] In the 1930s, he was a founding member and leader of the Croatian fascist[5] ultra-nationalist separatist movement, the Ustaše. In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the \"\"puppet state\"\" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   \"\n",

Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a \"\"mum\"\" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking \"\"research\"\" from questionable sources and only ever \"\"research\"\" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have \"\"won\"\" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6.

Of course the calculated figures are no better than the numbers they are based on and care must be taken to avoid any such implication. A simple example is the calculation and addition of metric units when measurements are given in a non-metric system (here care must be taken to avoid changing the precision of the measure). So, do the calculations and add the percentages and violetriga won't revert without a specific and clear policy. Meanwhile, Fill - your comments are getting quite pointy, please tone it down a bit.

      "Weasel Words\n",
      "Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from \"\"some say\"\" to \"\"BUsh's critics\"\" to \"\"Michael Moore\"\" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  \"\"Michael Moore said whatever\"\".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been \"\"long accused\"\" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean \"\"you can find it somewhere else\"\", it means \"\"It's been or can be verified to be true\"\".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citing the opinions of these articles\n",
      "Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this \"\"particularly notable because\"\" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.\n",
      "It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of \"\"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial\"\", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's \"\"sourced\"\". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.\n",
      "So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.\n",
      "Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).\n",
      "This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse\n",

However, I'm continually being wrongly accused of \"\"unconstructive\"\" or \"\"disruptive\"\" edits which is NOT my intent at all! In addition, my edit has been reverted several times for no apparent legitimate reason! The only thing I can figure is perhaps certain individuals are afraid of any new revelations that just might derail everything they have been trained to believe. So, the only course of action is obviously to censor those who don't agree with sensationalistic garbage. Well, my plan is to appeal these wrongful actions against me and make certain as many people as possible are informed about this. I'm going to publicly reveal everything that has been done to me and let everyone know how \"\"Wikipedia\"\" censors people who truly haven't done anything wrong simply because they THINK they can!\n",

Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.\n",

Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. \n",

In terms of engagement; honestly I have tried. I tried to engage with you and your supporters (who I think could equally be seen as a \"\"noisy\"\" minority trying to subvert community process); but just got indirect incivility, bluster and poorly focused ideas (i.e. on \"\"paid\"\", not \"\"advocacy\"\"). The discussion so far has spectacularly failed to intelligently engage the core issues or consider the significant areas Wikipedia fails in protecting companies from harm (you FAQ being a case in point; it focuses on the, important, negative aspects of paid advocacy - but doesn't contain any helpful self-criticism). Then I tried to engage the paid advocates, but your Bright Line comments appear to have alienated most of those from being interested in dialogue. So I keep doing my bit on the sidelines addressing actual content issues; it's not glamorous but it at least picks away at the core matter. What upsets me most is that you seem to be casting my viewpoint (that a bright line is impractical and wouldn't change much, that we don't handle issues with company articles well at all, that being paid to write about something doesn't mean you can't ever be objective) as \"\"ErrantX thinks the community wants paid advocates to be able to advocate on Wikipedia\"\".

The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.\n",

      "\n",
      "From a statistical and historical perspective one of the most important books of 2009 was the first volume of Ian Maun's series on eighteenth century cricket. In fact, after delving into this rich assemblage of material, published in association with both the MCC and the ACS, it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades. This claim is based on the fact that the author, who works at Exeter University, has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early 1700s. \n",
      "\n",
      "This book draws heavily from newspapers, journals, letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections, as well as other resources not generally available to, or used by, the majority of cricket historians, including history books, dictionaries, novels, plays and poems. Moreover, this is not a reworking of other writers contributions, as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on 18th century cricket. Indeed, this book includes more than 200 references to cricket which, until now, have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled. One can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series. \n",
      "\n",
      "The work stemmed several years ago from the author’s desire to understand the relationship of the Hambledon Club’s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days. What started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history.\n",
      "\n",
      "This period of tricorn hats, curved bats and two-stump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the year-by-year listing of references, supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images. As such, it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover. Instead, it is a fantastic reference book with, as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background, a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools. \n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, in his accompanying notes, the publisher claims that this book “will assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and 18th century cricket history.” I would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come, the author’s name will be spoken of in the same breath as Haygarth, Waghorn or Buckley.

Then you allowed their messages to be deleted which quite clearly show they are willing to undergo teaching, but because it wasn't from you, you didn't like that did you? Without a doubt the removal of barnstars and reaction to the welcome message was beyond the pale, and should have been dealt with by a short admin block, but your dishonesty surrounding this matter is utterly repulsive.

My comment about Wikipedia review was meant to state that he/she probably had some sort of idea about how attitudes work here, which has been proven absolutely right, sadly.

See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started.

I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS. And even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

      "How can “Rangers” gain league/SFA membership when they cannot produce requisite three years of accounts? The SFA answer: ” the…policy relates to applications for a new membership. In this case, Rangers Newco will be applying for the transfer of an existing membership held with the Oldco. Rangers Oldco submitted the necessary financial information for 2009 and 2010. It did not submit for the year 2011, which resulted in the Judicial Panel sanctioning the club a total of £160,000 for various breaches of its Articles of Association, and also imposing a transfer embargo which has been subsequently set aside after the Court of Session ruling by Lord Glennie.” That is – transferring old to new is not the same as a new club pitching up and wanting in. . Hopefully it will all be sorted soon.\n",

Also you forget the common usage of Arjuna and Yudhistra is Arjun and Yudhistir. However wherever they are mentioned on Wikipedia their Sanskritized names are used. Also the common usage is actually the Hindi version of their names. We can't just change a name because its usage is different in the majority language. Whenever names of Hindu deities or mythological characters are mentioned, Sanskritized names are mostly used. You can see that in all articles about Hnduism on Wikipedia. Therefore I ask you to stop disputing over this issue especially since Sanskritized names are the common usage on Wikipedia.\n",

I do not think this can be excluded as a form of Christianity without committing some basic problems in logic in regards to this definition, in particular the No True Scotsman fallacy. Until you have a good source that not only makes the case but represents the scholarly consensus on the question of a definition of Christianity that is sufficiently inclusive but still exclusive of PC as one of its manifestations of the religion, we do not get to delete the factual statement that PC is a form of Christianity. At most we can state that it is disputed, which Giovanni has done. It does not make any claim regarding the compatibility of Christianity with Nazism, but it does say that PC is a form of Christianity that is consistent with Nazism. If you dispute this, then please state what part parts of PC are not consistent with Nazism as an ideology? Lastly the major problem with your version is that it assumes there is such as thing as one kind or type of Christianity, which is of course not true, or begs the question.

I've linked the word for people who seem to forget what that is,\"\" which surpasses any of my comments in everything but cleverness.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"\"indiscriminate collection of information\"\" section of WP:NOT does not explicitly cover the issue, as Jeffrey O. Gustafson seems to believe, and I believe there is definitely room for some POV. Again, this could have been settled in a debate, but Jeffrey O. Gustafson was just too good for that. He went on repeatedly deleting the section even after I added a big honkin notice that said not to for the time being. YOU tell me what I was supposed to do.  \"\n",

I would argue that Marshall's brothers and Carl the bartender may have appeared in enough episodes of HIMYM to get articles, but if HIMYM is all they have done then they fail the GNG. Given that day players are unlikely to ever bass the bar for GNG there is little point in redlinking every extra on HIMYM. The director of Zombieland deserves an article, Boy #1 in episode 9 of season 5 of HIMYM does not. Red links are useful, but redlinks everywhere do not help.

      "Ok, and after this here is now the detailled technical explanation and conclusive evidence for the UE categories and their achievable throughput: The calculation of the theoretical DL throughput in MBit/s according to the largest available carrier bandwidth of 20 MHz  is as follows: A 20 MHz carrier consists of 100 Ressource Blocks (RB). Each RB consists of 12 Subcarriers (SC), which can be divided into 2 time slots (TS) each that carry 7 ODFM-Symbols each. Further we have a QAM modulation scheme. The maximum QAM specified is 64QAM, which means there are 6 bits/symbol. Additionally we have 2x2 MIMO antenna technology which allows two parallel data layers (L). In total this results in: 100 RB * 12 SC * 2 TS * 7 ODFM-Symbols * 6 bit/Symbol * 2 L = 201,6 MBit/s (Absolute theoretical technical maximum DL data rate per 20 MHz carrier). [] (page 3).\n",
      "Now let's take a look at the UE categories. This information derives from the specification document 3GPP TS 36.213 [] (page 25 to 34): Let's take a look at table 7.1.7.1-1:\n",
      "Cat 4 Devices use coding scheme MCS28 for DL and MCS23 for UL. This leads to TBS Index 26 for DL and 21 for UL. Looking at table 7.1.7.2.1 we now look at N_PRB (# of Ressource Blocks) = 100 (corresponds to 20 MHz carrier). For the TCS indices above we find 75376 and 51024 respectively. This results in 51,024 MBit/s for the UL. For the downlink we have 2x2 MIMO, so there are 2 Layers. Corresponding to table 7.1.7.2.2: The available number of ressource blocks 75376 (SISO) translates to 149776 for 2x2 MIMO resulting in 149,776 MBit/s ~ 150 MBit/s. As can be seen this ist a bit less than the 2*75,376=150,752 MBit/s which are stated in the 3GPP UE table Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306.\n",
      "Cat 3 Devices use coding scheme MCS23 for DL and UL. So with the explanation above we find: 51024 resulting in 51,024 MBit/s for UL again and with 2x2 MIMO for DL 101,8 MBit/s or simply 2*51,024=102,048 MBit/s (Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306).\n",
      "If we now reduce the carrier block size to 10 MHz - what happens? The amount of ressource blocks reduces from 100 to 50 - that's all. The MCS coding scheme stays the same. The conclusion is that a Cat4 device is able to achieve a theoretical troughput of 73,712 MBit/s with 10 MHz (50 RB) (Tables 7.1.7.2.1 & 7.1.7.2.2) of spectrum. Subsequently a Cat3 device in contrast can only reach 50,024 MBit/s according to these two tables and not around 75 MBit/s as previously discussed. I hope this clarified the issue so far. I doubt, that the development group is wrong here in their own specification.   20:26\n",

The few invited friends are mostly companies who could not compete in open tender and can only get the work from taking non-elected public officials golfing and god knows what else. All that is evident is that public works cost up to 100% or more than it should and they are not subject to Auditor General control. The public money is mostly wasted this way forcing our taxes here to keep escalating out of control. I don't know about other parts of the world, but most honest democratic countries have checks and balances in place. Not in the Regions of Ontario which is basically one big networked secret organization where they are pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars by things like not conducting completive (and no tender at all sometimes) so they can help their friends get high prices for their public works contracts. I picked Peel as examples out because they are the biggest and wasting the most money each year.

      "Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.\n",
      "Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.\n",

      "Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: \"\"They control our systems of information.\"\" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to \"\"prove\"\" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    \"\n",

      "First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page, and now I know - the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap, and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out, you're prepared to shut me up, forcibly (and more despicably, others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all). Well done. Now the \"\"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia\"\" can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesn't have to exlain why he thinks a 20,000 word article and a 15,000 word article on something that's being reported around the world, has \"\"negligible encyclopedic value\"\". And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising \"\"most right and proper good humor\"\" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a \"\"Rambling Man\"\". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name \"\"Bishonen\"\" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase \"\"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger\"\" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).\"\n",

      "I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called \"\"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,\"\" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax\"\", or \"\"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation.\"\" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the \"\"\"\"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident\"\" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk \"\n",

      "Once you understand that most of the false claims from Debian and it's sockpuppets are based on attempts to reverse the timeline (in order to confuse cause and reaction) it is easy to look for hints that prove claims from Debian as false.

Repeating a false claim thousands of times does not make it correct, but Debian just uses copies of their false claims to \"\"proove\"\" their claims. So what remains? The only provable facts are that Debian started to attack cdrtools in spring 2004 and that Debian at the same time stopped distributing the original cdrtools in favor of their own defective fork from spring 2004 that was later reamed (on my instructions) in autumn 2006.

      "MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  \n",
      "HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  \n",
      "DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. \n",
      "REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  \n",
      "NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. \n",
      "INTERESTING FACTS: \n",
      "Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.\n",

      "Thank you for welcoming me, Materialscientist. After some time here I can tell you that I really admire WP as a joint effort by many to create something constructive. The several weeks I have been here has been an interesting experience. I learned a lot, wandering around the Random articles. I also tried to contribute on issues that I know well. I had my share of learning other people's academic formation and their inner world (psychologies)i.e. how they react to the unknown or suppressed. As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work. To cut a long story short, I think I have been doing my humble contribution to the WP but believe could have done more in this rather short period, should I not faced reactionary attitudes, especially on \"\"national\"\" issues. It is really astonishing to see how people react to editing events that have occurred before our grandfathers were born, if they suspect their world of conceived reality is threatened. Never mind if these words look confusing to you, because they also are for me. I know I simply received a -perhaps automated- welcome message from you and am not expecting an answer to these lines. Indeed I am writing more as a factor of self inspection and will certainly erase these lines after a short while. All the best.  \"\n",

So, if someone feels something is missing from an article, they are free to edit in and source what they believe is missing.  Then, of course, their own edits are open to a challenge.  All I've seen here, and elsewhere are complaints and tagging about POV.  After a while, this is repetitive and just not productive. And of course, none of us work for anyone else at Wikipedia, no one gets to boss anyone around or intimidate anyone into writing for them.  No one here can force anyone else here to obey their will.

(The ability of Multics to dynamically link to a subroutine in any 'file' in the filesystem was a key thing in making this work - you could compile a new command, and then try it out right away, without having to link up a new version of the command interpreter.) Multics did always have the ability for anyone to start a subsidiary process, but it just wasn't used much.  (talk)\n",
